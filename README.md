# bootiful-spring-boot-kotlin

## Description

This project is based on [Josh Long](https://github.com/joshlong)'s Spring Boot demo and the transcript of his session. I've taken the tech stack and code scenario he used in his demo and put a little bit of my own style on it.

## Tech stack

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Spring Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith)
- [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai)

## What you can do with this demo

- [Restricting access between packages](https://docs.spring.io/spring-modulith/reference/fundamentals.html#modules.application-modules) using Spring Modulith
- Compare API load test results with and without [virtual threads enabled](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/spring-application.html#features.spring-application.virtual-threads)
- [Storing data from a database in a vector store](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/vectordbs.html) with Spring AI
- Vector similarity search from vector store
- Querying the [Ollama chat client](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chat/ollama-chat.html)
- [Native compilation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/gradle-plugin/aot.html#aot.processing-applications) via [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/)
- [Automatically run Docker Compose](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.docker-compose) when the application starts

## Disclamer

- This project is a demo in the nature of introducing a specific feature. While many things were considered, the code style may not be consistent in some places.
- This project is based on [Josh Long](https://github.com/joshlong)'s demo scenario, but it's not verbatim - I've added my own style to it.
